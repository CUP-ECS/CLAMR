ADD COMMENTS TO ALL THE CODE!!!

Discuss the data structures used in exa... what's the best data structure to
work with?

Focuses:
	Hilbert Curve, how will local memory accesses be optimized
	Optimizing the K-D Tree
	Implementing the kernel for computing the updates determined
	 by the shallow water wave equations
	** Local memory access strategy should be discussed as a group


Discuss duties for OpenGL implementation and bug checking
	- Add MPE option?
	- Not as portable but could include necessary libraries in the tar file
	  of clamr itself

Run valgrind to find sources of memory errors

Profile code
	How to delegate? One person profiles or everyone profiles current code
	responsibility? Discuss in conference room where the largest
	consumption of cpu cycles is occurring and determine where additional
	optimizations are needed, aside from the computations that will be
	put into the kernel.

Add coarsening to the grid

// Keyboard commands to add to exa
Pause function

Possible work tasks:
   Symmetry checks
   Fix Hydro to conserve mass
   Alternative to current hash key
   Putting kD Tree on the GPU
   Adding pseudo-Z-order insertion

Command line options
   Add different problem setups such as sloped wave in x, y, and diagonal directions to help check algorithm
