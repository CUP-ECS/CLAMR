CMake flags have been added for reproducible runs.

Compile with -DUPDATE_EQUATION_SPECIAL={Kahan,pairwise} to use Kahan Sums or "pairwise" sums for the height update equation.

If you choose one of the above, you may also compile with -DUPDATE_EQUATION_SORTED for ordering the sum.
When defined, it defaults to an ascending sort (lowest to highest), but you can specify -DUPDATE_EQUATION_SORTED=d for a descending sort. Currently, a sort of sums that are not Kahan or pairwise is not implemented.

Kahan sums and the specific pairwise sum tested are located in specialsums.h

Many parenthesization orderings for the update were tested. To compile for a specific ordering, use the CMake flag UPDATE_EQUATION_VERSION=(number). This defaults to 0, which corresponds to the original ordering and parentheses in CLAMR.

The many orderings/parenthesizations are in update_eqn_versions.h, and are generated via a Python script update_eqn_versions.py.
