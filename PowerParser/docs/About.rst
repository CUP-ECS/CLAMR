*PowerParser* capabilities go far beyond simple parsing and setting of variables.  For *PowerParser*,
the parsing concept is extended to think of the user input as a set of commands to control the operation
of the code.

*PowerParser* handles command line arguments and interprets the user input file. It does the following:

  * Parses the exectuable command line
  * Reads the user input file.
  * Compiles the user input file, handling variables, math expressions, and loops
  * Provides functions for extracting data from the compiled file

Some of the extended features of *PowerParser* include:

  * Count before reading
  * Multi-line comments
  * User defined variables
  * Math Expressions
  * Intrinsic functions
  * If statements
  * Loops
  * Subroutines
  * Include other files
  * Execution line arguments
  * Checking input
